# TinyMCE IMCE plugin

Provides a button for TinyMCE to insert images directly with
 [IMCE](https://backdropcms.org/project/imce).

That's an alternative to the default image browser plugin (backdropimage), if
 you prefer to handle your files with IMCE.

Provides a context toolbar to set the alternative text and image alignment in
 place.

 system.
